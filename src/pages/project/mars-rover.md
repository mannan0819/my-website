This web app is a voting system. 

It uses a library called Prisma to handle the data, and includes a variety of custom React components to handle different aspects of the voting process. These components include a button for submitting votes, a loading indicator, and an option component for displaying individual voting options. 

The app also uses the Material UI library and dayjs for date and time manipulation. Overall, it is a well-structured and functional voting system.
